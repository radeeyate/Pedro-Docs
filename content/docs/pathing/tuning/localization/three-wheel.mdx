<Callout title="Prerequisites" type="info">
  Ensure that three odometry pods are connected: two that are parallel to the length
  of your chassis and another that is perpendicular to your chassis length. These should be plugged
  into ports that have motors on them preferably. Due to technical limitations on REV hubs, encoder ports
  0 and 3 are the fastest and are recommended for the two parallel pods.
</Callout>

## Setup

In `Constants.java`, add an instance of `ThreeWheelConstants`. Make sure to replace the hardware map names
with the actual names of the motor port they are plugged into.

```java title="Constants.java"
public static ThreeWheelConstants localizerConstants = new ThreeWheelConstants()
            .forwardTicksToInches(.001989436789)
            .strafeTicksToInches(.001989436789)
            .turnTicksToInches(.001989436789)
            .leftPodY(1)
            .rightPodY(-1)
            .strafePodX(-2.5)
            .leftEncoder_HardwareMapName("leftFront")
            .rightEncoder_HardwareMapName("rightRear")
            .strafeEncoder_HardwareMapName("rightFront")
            .leftEncoderDirection(Encoder.FORWARD)
            .rightEncoderDirection(Encoder.FORWARD)
            .strafeEncoderDirection(Encoder.FORWARD);
```

Then, add `.threeWheelLocalizer` to `createFollower`:

```java title="Constants.java"
return new FollowerBuilder(followerConstants, hardwareMap)
    .threeWheelLocalizer(localizerConstants)
    /* other builder steps */
    .build();
```

### Offsets

You must also set your odometry pod offsets, which are
relative to your robot's center of rotation. You can use the diagram below
to find them. **Offsets are in inches.**

  src="/docs/odometry-dark.png"
  alt="Odometry Pod Offset Diagram"
/>

Once you have found your offsets, add them to your localizer constants by
using `.leftPodY()`, `.rightPodY()` and `.strafePodX()`.

## Encoder Directions

We will now determine the encoder directions. First, select and run
localization test under the localization folder in the tuning OpMode. Then,
move the robot forward. The x coordinate should increase. Next, move the
robot left. The y coordinate should increase. If these do not happen, the
respective encoders must be the inverse of what they currently are (NOTE:
both parallel pods must be inversed if the x coordinate decreases).
To reverse an encoder, add

To reverse an encoder, add one of the following to `ThreeWheelConstants`:

```java title="Constants.java"
.leftEncoderDirection(Encoder.REVERSE)
.rightEncoderDirection(Encoder.FORWARD)

// and/or:

.strafeEncoderDirection(Encoder.REVERSE)
```

<Callout title="Important" type="warning">
  If when you push the robot forward both x and y change, it is likely that either your offsets have the wrong sign,
  or that the hardwareMap is incorrect (ie. forward encoder is actually your strafe encoder and vise versa)
</Callout>

## Forward Tuner

We will now adjust multipliers that convert encoder ticks into real-world
measurements: inches. This ensures your localizer's readings are accurate.

<Callout title="Tip" type="info">
  It is recommended that you run these tests multiple times and average the results,
  as it can result in more accurate localization.
</Callout>

In the tuning OpMode, under localization, select and start the forward tuner.
Then, push the robot **forward 48 inches** (exactly 2 field tiles). This
distance is configurable if needed. Once you push the robot forward, two
numbers will be displayed on telemetry:

- The distance the robot thinks it has traveled
- The multiplier; this is the number you want.

Add the multiplier to your `ThreeWheelConstants` by adding the following.

```java title="Constants.java"
.forwardTicksToInches(multiplier)
```

## Lateral Tuner

The lateral tuner is very similar to the forward tuner, except it is
sideways. In the tuning OpMode, under localization, select and start the
lateral tuner. Push the robot **left 48 inches** (exactly 2 field tiles). As
with the forward tuner, this distance is configurable.

Lastly, add the multiplier to `ThreeWheelConstants` by adding the following line.

```java title="Constants.java"
.strafeTicksToInches(multiplier)
```

## Turn Tuner

The turn tuner is similar to both the forward tuner and lateral tuner, except it is
rotational. Place the robot so it aligns to a fixed reference point (e.g., edge of a field tile).
In the tuning OpMode, under localization, select and start the
turn tuner. Rotate the robot **counterclockwise one full rotation**. As
with the previous tuners, this amount is configurable.

Lastly, add the multiplier to `ThreeWheelConstants` by adding the following line.

```java title="Constants.java"
.turnTicksToInches(multiplier)
```

## Testing the localizer

Once you have completed the tuning steps, you can test your localizer as
described
[on the localization page](/docs/pathing/tuning/localization#localization-test).

Congratulations on successfully tuning your localizer!
