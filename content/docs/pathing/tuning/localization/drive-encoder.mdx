import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout'

<Callout title="Prerequisites" type="info">
  Ensure that you have all four drive motors encoders connected to their
  respective ports on
  a REV hub.
</Callout>

## Setup

In `Constants.java`, add an instance of `DriveEncoderConstants`. Make sure to
replace the motor names and directions with the correct ones.

```java title="Constants.java"
public static DriveEncoderConstants localizerConstants = new DriveEncoderConstants()
            .rightFrontMotorName("rf")
            .rightRearMotorName("rr")
            .leftRearMotorName("lr")
            .leftFrontMotorName("lf")
            .leftFrontEncoderDirection(Encoder.FORWARD)
            .leftRearEncoderDirection(Encoder.FORWARD)
            .rightFrontEncoderDirection(Encoder.FORWARD)
            .rightRearEncoderDirection(Encoder.FORWARD);
```

Then, add `.driveEncoderLocalizer` to `createFollower`:

```java title="Constants.java"
return new FollowerBuilder(followerConstants, hardwareMap)
    .driveEncoderLocalizer(localizerConstants)
    /* other builder steps */
    .build();
```

## Robot Dimensions

Measure your robot's wheelbase in inches.

- Length: the distance between the front and back wheels
- Width: the distance between the left and right wheels

In your `DriveEncoderConstants`, use `.robotWidth()` and `.robotLength()` to
set the values you just measured.

## Forward Tuner

We will now adjust multipliers that convert encoder ticks into real-world
measurements: inches. This ensures your localizer's readings are accurate.

<Callout title="Tip" type="info">
  It is recommended that you run these tests multiple times and average the
  results,
  as it can result in more accurate localization.
</Callout>


In the tuning OpMode, under localization, select and start the forward tuner.
Then, push the robot **forward 48 inches** (exactly 2 field tiles). This
distance is configurable if needed. Once you push the robot forward, two
numbers will be displayed on telemetry:

- The distance the robot thinks it has traveled
- The multiplier; this is the number you want.

Add the multiplier to your `DriveEncoderConstants` by adding the following.

```java title="Constants.java"
.forwardTicksToInches(multiplier)
```

## Lateral Tuner

The lateral tuner is very similar to the forward tuner, except it is
sideways. In the tuning OpMode, under localization, select and start the
lateral tuner. Push the robot **left 48 inches** (exactly 2 field tiles). As
with the forward tuner, this distance is configurable.

Lastly, add the multiplier to `DriveEncoderConstants` by adding the following line.

```java title="Constants.java"
.strafeTicksToInches(multiplier)
```

## Turn Tuner

The turn tuner is again, similar to both the forward tuner and lateral tuner, except it is
rotational. Place the robot so it aligns to a fixed reference point (eg. edge of a field tile).
In the tuning OpMode, under localization, select and start the
turn tuner. Rotate the robot **counterclockwise one full rotation**. As
with the previous tuners, this amount is configurable.

Lastly, add the multiplier to `DriveEncoderConstants` by adding the following line.

```java title="Constants.java"
.turnTicksToInches(multiplier)
```

## Testing the localizer

Once you have completed the tuning steps, you can test your localizer as
described
[on the localization page](/docs/pathing/tuning/localization#localization-test).

Congratulations on successfully tuning your localizer!
